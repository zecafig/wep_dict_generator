This python code is for studying purpose. It generates a list of all possible combinations of the variable 'sequence', with a number of digits set in repeat parameter.

Run it typing:

```console
python3 wep_dict_generator.py
```

The 'repeat' parameter is set to 2 on this code. To generate a wep dictionary with 10 digits, set it to 10. Warning: this will take long hours, or days...
